# Scheduler Implementation For An Operating System
##### CMPE 322 - FALL 2018

The project is to implement a preemptive priority scheduling algorithm. I implemented this program using C++ in the Linux platform with GCC/G++ Compiler. 

Linux Version: 18.04.1 LTS (Bionic Beaver)

GCC Version: gcc (Ubuntu 7.3.0-27ubuntu1~18.04) 7.3.0

## How to run
1. Open terminal in Linux
2. Go to the project directory (named “Scheduler”)
3. Run the following commands

`$ cmake CMakeLists.txt`

`$ make`

4. Run the program with the proper arguments. First argument is the definition file and the rest is the programming code files.  (If the definition and programming code files are not in the same directory, you need to give their full path.)

`$ ./Scheduler definition.txt  code1.txt  code2.txt  code3.txt  code4.txt`
